#Business Card Controller

##Concept
Basically, I just wanted to test out using an integreated USB port. The concept is kind of compromised by forcing the user to do some soldering, but I tried to make it fairly easy. In addition, I designed a case for 3d printing so that the keyboard can either be placed on a desk and used as a macro pad, or held in the hand in a reasonable approximation of a gameboy.
